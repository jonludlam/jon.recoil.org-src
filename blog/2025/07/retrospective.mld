{0 4 months in, a retrospective}

@published 2025-07-17

It's been four months since starting back at the university, and time to do a bit of
a retrospective and forward-looking plan for the next 3-4 months.

{1 What's happened?}
It's been a bit of a daunting experience, landing in a team that are already working
one hundred miles an hour on things well out of my comfort zone. I've been going to
group meetings and having lots of interesting conversations, but I've found it
difficult to make the next steps happen. One area where I've had some success is in
working with Sadiq on LLMs - in particular, getting local LLMs to solve programming
exercises that we both {{:https://toao.com/blog/ocaml-local-code-models}wrote}
{{!/site/blog/2025/05/page-"ticks-solved-by-ai"}up}. I've also been working with him
on taking the output from the docs CI and {{:https://github.com/sadiqj/odoc-llm}summarising it with LLMs} in order to
create an MCP server that would help tools like {{:https://anthropic.com/}Claude Code}
to choose OCaml packages to solve users' problems.

It's been somewhat easier, partly due to inertia, to carry on with projects that had been in flight at the time
I started. Things like getting the odoc 3 generated docs onto ocaml.org, which is
finally complete only {{!/site/blog/2025/07/page-"odoc-3-live-on-ocaml-org"}as of this week!}.
This has taken a whole lot of time, but I'm really pleased with the end results. There's
still an awful lot of improvements that I'd like to see made, which, after drawing breath for
a couple of weeks, I'll be writing down.

An itch I've been wanting to scratch for a long time has been to look at client-side ocaml
notebooks. I decided to make this an integral {{!/site/blog/2025/04/page-"this-site"}feature of this blog},
and I've learnt an awful
lot doing it. An important feature of this that I've been keeping in mind is the idea that
we could use the ocaml-docs-ci tool to build the libraries, which would allow us to host
a toplevel for every single package in opam-repository - allowing at best 
{{:https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/an-example-for-every-ocaml-package/16953/10}interactive examples}, and at bare minimum merlin for
live type-checking and autocompletion. The important principles to keep in mind for this
are that:

- We have one 'toplevel' javascript file, and libraries and cmis are dynamically loaded
- The interface between the frontend and the worker must not rely on a matched pair, e.g.
  an OCaml-5.3-compiled frontend might be talking to an OCaml-4.08-compiled worker thread - 
  or even an oxcaml one!

I have this all working on my blog, where I have both an oxcaml worker and a standard ocaml
worker and they both dynamically load in libraries and cmis as specified on the page.

I've also supervised a 1A course for the first time - {{:https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2425/IntroProb/}Introduction to Probability},
and I've done some marking for the 1A Foundations of Computer Science. 

Something that I'd been expecting to do a lot on was work with oxcaml, but as the release
happened later than anticipated and it coinciding with the marking and supervising, I've
not done quite as much of this as I had thought I would. In addition, I had anticipated
working on Odoc to start implementing the new features of oxcaml, but to avoid
duplicating effort I've been waiting for the patches that have already been written at Jane Street to at least
get odoc to compile, which have taken longer than I had hoped to get to me.

{1 What's next}
More interestingly, what's next? What do I think I'll be doing for the next few months?
As always, there's way too much work to do, so this is a brain-dump of everything:

{2 Teaching}
A looming, terrifying, but tremendously exciting opportunity is teaching of 1A Foundations
of Computer Science. This is amongst the first courses we teach our incoming undergraduates,
currently lectured by {{:https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2425/FoundsCS/}Anil}. He's on sabbatical this year, and
has asked me to step up and lecture it. I anticipate the preparation work for this taking
up a good chunk of my time over the next few months, but at least I can be preparing while
I don't also have tutees and supervisees to worry about!

{2 Efficient and reusable CI}
One area I'd like to see progress with is to extract from docs CI the logic that I've been
using to do efficient builds of packages. As I previously {{!/site/blog/2025/07/page-"odoc-3-live-on-ocaml-org"}wrote about},
the new CI system is far more efficient than some of the other ocurrent-based pipelines,
and it would save a huge amount of compute time if we were to take this tech and apply it
elsewhere. A recent chat with {{:https://anil.recoil.org/}Anil} helped me to realise that
one of the reasons that Docker took off so well was that it allowed people to share environemnts
so incredibly easily, and this is a lesson that the docs CI has failed to learn.

So, how might we take what we've got and produce something useful to everyone? We need to
take a hammer to the fracture points of the docs CI service and split it into individually
useful parts. Here are some next steps as I see them now. Let's take the solver out of docs
CI, and have a service whose sole job is to create a repository of
up-to-date solutions for all versions of all packages in opam-repository. These are the data
that allow us to build the tree of package builds.

Turn these solutions into one giant build. Perhaps a script? Maybe a giant buildkit dockerfile? This is 
very similar to Mark Elvers' {{:https://github.com/mtelvers/ohc}day10} project. We can
get this running on a big machine and just see how fast we can build everything. The key thing
here is that it should be {e trivial} to run this on a linux box. A raspberry pi or a 768-core
behemoth with 3TiB of ram.

These tools can then be used as the foundation for other CI systems. For opam-repo-ci, where we
should be able to do the builds for a new package incredibly quickly. For opam-health-check, where
we currently build foundational packages like dune and findlib {i thousands of times} per run. 

Once we've got the packages built, docs CI is simply a pass over the top of the built artifacts.
ocaml-docs-ci already demonstrates this - it only takes a few hours to rebuild all the docs when
a new version of odoc is released, but in a way that only benefits docs! All the CI systems should
be able to use this. 

We should also then be able to run js_of_ocaml on the libraries to build to infrastructure needed
for the per-package toplevels for ocaml.org that I mentioned above. Each of these steps should be
separate stages in a pipeline - one where each step produces artifacts for the next to consume.

When we mix in some of the projects that other people in the team are working on, like David's
work on {{:https://www.dra27.uk/blog/}relocatable OCaml}, we've got something that might be able
to form a basis for a binary cache for Dune Package Management, particularly when we involve
Ryan's {{:https://ryan.freumh.org/papers.html#2025-arxiv-hyperres}Hyperres} paper so we might
check that dependencies from outside of the OCaml universe are correct. Can we use {{:https://github.com/quantifyearth/shark}Patrick and Michael's shark}
to do the build steps? Can we use these images to serve up toplevels for ocaml.org that are
{e real toplevels} rather than javascript toplevels? There are a lot of interesting directions
to take this work.

{2 Odoc paper}
An area where I've really made a shockingly small amount of progress is to write up all the
work that's gone into Odoc over the past 6 (!!!) years.

{2 Odoc notebooks}
This needs to be tidied up and a v0.1 released. In particular, the work on js_top_worker 
might well be shared with Arthur's {{:https://github.com/art-w/x-ocaml}x-ocaml} for a unified
toplevel experience.

{2 AI work}
I'd like to carry on the work I've started with Sadiq on the interaction of LLMs with OCaml.
Getting the package search to work sensibly for an MCP server is first on the list, but also
doing some reinforcement learning to improve specifically the perfomance on OCaml is very
interesting, but not something I've managed to carve out the time for yet. Something along
the lines of {{:https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21798}swesmith} but adapted for OCaml.

{2 Oxcaml Odoc}
Odoc needs to have some work done on it to support the new work that's gone into oxcaml,
for example documenting of the modes. This is something I do expect to be working on soon.

{2 Dune and odoc}
Work needs to be done on the dune rules for odoc, which currently only support the feature-set
in odoc 2.x. Paul-Elliot has {{:https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11716}done some work on this},
but much more needs to be done.

{2 Further general odoc work}
- Better source rendering
- Syntax for linking to source
- Custom tags (used in odoc_notebook)
- Web-native rendering, for embedding odoc in a website
- Unifying paths and cpaths (https://github.com/jonludlam/odoc/tree/parameterised-paths)

{1 What to {i actually} do?}

There are a lot of things in the above list. I'm not sure yet how I manage to figure out
what I actually end up doing, and how that helps me to help Tarides, to fit in as a
useful member of the EEG group, and to make sure I'm doing what's right for my own
future.
